An Excel file with the output will aslo be created in the matlab path. Sheet 1 will have All data except for dates. please chech sheet 2/3/4... for dates.








Problem Statement 2
Static Force Analyser
File Name - (mechathon_pbl_2.mlx)


User Input: 
1) Number of Forces 
2) Force Coordinates
3) If Force is known, input 1 else 0 
4) Force Vector length
5) Theta(angle) in degree w.r.t. x axis

Output:
1) Force Vector length for all the forces
2) Angle with respect to x axis

Co-ordinate System: It is assumed that the X-axis of Co-ordinate system is parellel to the length of link with origin lying on one of the nodes
Note: The user will provide Forcce vector diagram for one link only. if the Force is unknown, the user will input 0 in prompt. similarly for the direction.
